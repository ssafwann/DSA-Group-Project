# Hash-Table-Project

This was a school project where we had to choose to use a one of the new data structure we would be learning to create this project. I decided to go with hash table
as the new data structure since it allows for O(1) insertion and O(1) searching at time.
The functions of the program include inserting records from a file to the hash table and searching, deleting, and sorting functions.

The collision dection method I used was seperate chaining.
The sorting algorithm I choose was selection sort.
